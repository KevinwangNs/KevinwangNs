- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KevinwangNs
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FPGA
- ðŸ“« Kevinwangns@gmail.com

- As an FPGA engineer with a full-time job, most of my works are commercial, so I'm not allowed to reveal the codes technically.
- In this repository, I will put on some projects written specifically for the job-seeking, so there won't be any IP issues.
- These simple projects will demonstrate how I write code.
