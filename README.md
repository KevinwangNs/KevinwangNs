- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KevinwangNs
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FPGA
- ðŸ“« Kevinwangns@gmail.com
- This account was created specifically for job seeking
- As an FPGA engineer with a full-time job, most of my works are commercial, so I'm not allowed to reveal the codes of them technically.
- This is a git repository where I will put on some projects written specifically for the job-seeking(to avoid copyright problems).
- These simple projects will demonstrate how I write codes and deal with the issues.
